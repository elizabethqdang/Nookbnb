# Airbnb Clone

## Introduction
Nookbnb is a single page MERN stack application that parodies off the concept and style of Airbnb. Drawing inspiration from the popular 'Animal Crossing' video game series, visitors to the site are able to browse rental listings for properties owned by Tom Nook himself.

## Feature Spotlight
### Custom Calendar Widget

This calendar widget, which was built from scratch, dynamically renders the correct amount of days for each month and allows users to choose a check-in and checkout date. A dropdown menu to choose how many guests will be staying in the rental is also available to the user. The widget enforces that there can only be a maximum of four guests and adjusts the editing buttons for each category of guests accordingly.
